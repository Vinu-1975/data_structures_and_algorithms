greedy:
-> the optimal solution to the subproblem can lead to global/overall optimal solution.
-> greedy approach alway schoose the steps which provide immediate benefit.
-> Mainly used for optimization problem(to find max or min of something)

-> The greedy approach has a few tradeoffs, which may make it suitable for optimization. One prominent reason is to achieve the most feasible solution immediately. In the activity selection problem

-> Greedy may not always lead to optimal global solution.
-> It does not consider the entire data. Does not consider future data and the choices
