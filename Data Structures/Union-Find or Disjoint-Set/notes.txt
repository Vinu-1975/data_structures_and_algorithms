-> two sets are disjoint if they don't have any elements in common i.e insersection of two sets is NULL

operations:
->adding new sets to disjoint set
->merging disjoin sets to single disjoint using UNION operation
->finding representative of a disjoint using FIND operation
->to check if two sets are disjoint

uses:
-> detect cycles in undirected graph
-> used in kruskal's algorithm to detect cycles
